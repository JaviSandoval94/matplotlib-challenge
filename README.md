# Introduction
Data is often better understook when it is visualized and used to tell a story. This project is an exercise to visually present analysis results using Jupyter Notebook and the Python Matplotlib library. The fictional company Pymaceuticals is screening potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a form of skin cancer, and this project aims to compare the performance of a drug of interest over a 45 days-long study run on 250 identifiesd with SCC tumor growth. The objectives are the following:

# Data set
The complete data set of this activity can be found in the `Mouse_metadata.csv` and `Study_results.csv` files, both included in this repository. These files were provided by the Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey Data Analytics Bootcamp for the February - August 2020 term.

# Code description
To run this analysis, make sure to have the complete folder available with the corresponding data sets in the adequate folder, as the `.ipynb` file calls them from your local folder.
